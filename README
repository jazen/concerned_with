= ConcernedWith, an ActiveRecord extension

ConcernedWith allows you to split up a model's several concerns into
separate files to keep your code clear and modularized.

This version is a bit more sophisticated as it uses the include-mechanism
instead of re-opening the model's class. It required a bit more setup
but provides more flexibility on the other hand.

Inspired by Rick Olson's original code.
